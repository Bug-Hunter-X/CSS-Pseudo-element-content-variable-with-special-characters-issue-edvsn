The CSS code has an unexpected behavior when a pseudo-element (::before or ::after) is used with a content property that refers to a variable containing a string with special characters like quotes or backslashes. The rendering differs from what is expected. For example: 

```css
:root {
  --my-string: "This is a string with \"quotes\"";
}

p { 
  ::before {
    content: var(--my-string);
  }
}
```
