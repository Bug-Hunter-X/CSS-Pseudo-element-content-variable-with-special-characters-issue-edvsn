To solve this issue, you should escape special characters within the CSS variable or use a different method for managing strings with special characters. One approach is to use CSS escape sequences for special characters like quotes and backslashes. For example:

```css
:root {
  --my-string: "This is a string with \"quotes\" and \\backslashes\";
}

p { 
  ::before {
    content: var(--my-string);
  }
}
```

Alternatively, use a different approach to manage strings, such as creating separate strings for different parts of the text, then concatenating them within the content property.
